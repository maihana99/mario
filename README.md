(mario - less.c) A program in C that recreates that pyramid and allows the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive int between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:

       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########

But prompts the user for an int for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:

  #
 ##
###

Re-prompts the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int altogether.
